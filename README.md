In this program, we define an abstract base class Shape using the ABC module, which represents a shape. The Shape class has an abstract method calculate_area() that is meant to be implemented by its subclasses. It also has getter and setter methods for the color attribute, demonstrating encapsulation.

We then create two concrete classes, Circle and Rectangle, which inherit from the Shape class. These classes provide their own implementations of the calculate_area() method.

We create instances of the Circle and Rectangle classes and use encapsulation to access and modify their attributes. Finally, we call the calculate_area() method on each object to calculate and display the respective areas.

Note that the abstract base class and abstract method help enforce abstraction by providing a common interface for all shapes while leaving the implementation details to the concrete classes. Encapsulation is achieved by using getter and setter methods to control access to the attributes of the objects.
